                    I am a final-year BTech Computer Science student at IIIT Dharwad, specializing in full stack development and machine learning. As an AI/ML Developer Intern at Vocab AI, I developed AI solutions and participated in technical meetings.
                    <br /><br />
                    I have built several projects, including an LLM Agent website and RecapAI, a Generative AI application. My tech stack includes Python, Langchain, and the MERN stack, allowing me to create robust web applications and AI models. 
                    <br /><br />
                    I actively participate in hackathons and coding competitions, achieving second place in a CSS battle and ranking in the Top 10 at the PeerlistXReplit Hackathon â€™23. I enjoy tackling complex problems and collaborating with others to create innovative solutions.
